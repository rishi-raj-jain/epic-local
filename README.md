To run this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishi-raj-jain/epic-local
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npx prisma migrate reset

# Developement
npm run dev & npx reflect dev
```

The important bits are:

- Learn about Reflect [rooms](https://hello.reflect.net/concepts/rooms) and [auth](https://hello.reflect.net/how/auth)
- Instead of fetching data via `loader`, data is fetched on the client side and mutations are authorized on the server so that they can run only for the authenticated user.
- `/reflect` is an added endpoint that helps authorize and verify the user with jsonwebtoken
- `root.tsx` contains the criticial piece of code that fetches and creates a logged in user room for Reflect to make changes into
